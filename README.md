# color-identifier

This is a small project to identify the name of the color at the location of a mouse click on an image. Support for keyboard event handlers might be added in the future.

It uses the OpenCV and Pandas libraries for Python. You need to have these libraries installed to run this application in a local environment.

To replace the default image with your own custom image, use a command line positional argument: `-i path/to/image.jpeg`

The list of color names used in this project, `color-names.csv`, was taken from this [source file](https://github.com/codebrainz/color-names/blob/master/output/colors.csv)
