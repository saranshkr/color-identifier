# color-identifier

This is a small fun project to identify the name of the color at the location of a mouse click on an image.

It uses the OpenCV and Pandas libraries for Python. You need to have these libraries installed to run this application in a local environment.

To replace the default image with your own custom image, use a command line positional argument: `-i path/to/image.jpeg`

The list of color names used in this project, `color-names.csv`, was taken from this [source file](https://github.com/codebrainz/color-names/blob/master/output/colors.csv).
