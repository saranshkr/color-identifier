# color-identifier

This is a small project to identify the name of the color at the location of a mouse click on an image. Support for keyboard event handlers might be added in the future.


It uses the OpenCV and Pandas libraries for Python. You need to have these libraries installed to run this application in a local environment.


To change the image being used, navigate to the main function inside color-identifier.py (scroll down) and change the 'image_path' variable to the path of your image. An argument parser will be added soon to enable command line use.
